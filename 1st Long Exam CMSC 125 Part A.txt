III. Process Synchronization

	IPC
	
	Three Issues on IPC
	
	
	
	Race Conditions
	
	Critical Region
	
	Critical Region Environment
		Entry Section
		
		Critical Section
		
		Exit Section
		
		Remainder Section
	
	
	How can we avoid Race Conditions?
	
		Mutual Exclusion
		
		Progress
		
		Bounded Wait
		
		
	Synchronization Primitives
	
		Sleep
		
		WakeUp
