
Thank you very much for this, no more CPU problems for me too.

Here's the step by step if you're not into computers.

1/ Open the Task Manager (and let if open)
2/ Go in C:\Windows\System32 and delete "igfxupdate.exe"
3/ Go in C:\Windows\SysWOW64 and check if "igfxupdate.exe" is also here, if yes delete it
4/ Open the windows services management console 
Start > Execute > services.msc or Start > type "services.msc" in the search bar (Windows 7)
5/ Look for "Search Indexer" -> Right click -> Properties and change the "Automatic" into "Disabled"
6/ Reboot 
7/ Open the Windows CMD as an Administrator
Start > type "cmd" in the search bar (Windows 7) -> Right click -> Run as an Administrator
8-> Type "sc delete SearchIndexer" then hit Enter

And you're done !




 Hi, after several hours of attemps I think I finally found the offender:
much probably a Trojan Generic KDV 792778, it pretends to be the windows service "Search Indexer" and it creates the fake executable: "igfxupdate.exe" which tries to connect in internet and rises the cpu load all the time till you open the task manager to hide itself..
So I solved the problem like this:
in the windows services management console I disabled the above fake windows service (it was in automatic start mode) and after I deleted the igfxupdate.exe file that was in the windows system32 folder..
I rebooted the pc and I deleted the same service with the command: "sc delete SearchIndexer"..
problem solved! cpu back to normal level, not more unwanted connections and not more igfxupdate files around ..
anyway for more safety it's better to do also a complete scan with a good antivirus/malware software
